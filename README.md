# Hi there 👋
My name is Fajra Risqulla, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at Telkom University. As an Android and Backend enthusiast, I recently completed the Bangkit program, specializing in Mobile Development.

During my time in the prestigious Bangkit program, I focused on Android development and had the opportunity to enhance my skills in Jetpack Compose, RESTful API, and Object-Oriented programming. As part of my capstone project at Bangkit, I actively contributed as an Android and Back-End Developer. I utilized Jetpack Compose to build engaging Android applications, while also working with technologies like HapiJS and Ktor to develop RESTful APIs and implement Web-socket functionality on the server side.

Looking ahead, my ambition is to establish a successful career as a Software Engineer upon graduation from the Bangkit program. I am truly passionate about crafting innovative solutions and leveraging my technical expertise to create impactful software products.
